# Hardware - Logic Gates and Circuits
* Explain what is meant by a truth table and apply your knowledge to a NAND gate.
What's meant by a truth table, referring to NAND gate is that it shows the nagatgives and positives in the inputs and outputs. 
* How does the NAND gate truth table compare to that of an AND gate?
The NAND gate truth table compares to an AND gate table is that they both show how each input and output works, excpet their opposite.
# Data Representation - Numeric conversions
* Explain the difference between decimal, binary and hexadecimal numbers
A decimal has 10 digits starting at zero to nine. Binary is used with numbers by the power of two and in binary, you only use zero or one. Lastly, hexadecimal has a base 16 system with numbers and letters.

# Data Representation: Hexadecimal Color Representation
* Explain the representation: #ff016b using the site: https://www.colorhexa.com/ff016b
The representation of #ff016b made a vivid pink color because of the angles and the diffrent percetages maded the color scheme. 
* When considering accessibility in web sites would this color be problematic? Explain what should be considered. Additional resource : https://a11yproject.com/posts/what-is-color-contrast/
I would believe the color would be problomatic because some people are color blind or have a very hard time reading brght colors.
